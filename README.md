# Bogotá Infrastructure Tracker

This project was sponsored by Bloomberg's Data For Good Exchange ([D4GX](https://www.bloomberg.com/lp/d4gx/)) program 2019 edition.

Bloomberg Associates Municipal Integrity Team worked with the City of Bogotá to implement an online platform that will give city managers and citizens access to synthesized information about local infrastructure projects. 
The tool also will allow citizens to provide feedback, with the goal of empowering them and bringing transparency to local government.

The Public Works Tracker, requested by the Peñalosa administration and overseen by [Veeduría Distrital of Bogotá](https://www.veeduriadistrital.gov.co), will enable city managers and citizens to see what projects are under construction throughout the city, such as schools, roadways, parks, and government buildings.
Citizens will be able to access this information via a QR code posted at each construction site, which will unlock the project’s timeline, budgeting data, and images. 
Its implementation reused an [open source code](https://github.com/datosgcba/obras-abiertas) developed by the City of Buenos Aires.

Bloomberg Associates’ Rose Gill Hearn says, “The tracker is a great transparency project intended to decrease public frustration, and inform people in real-time about what is being done to improve the city. It pulls together data that was siloed and it is the first time this much data on open public works projects — representing a total investment of $200 million USD — is going to be open to the public in this visible way.”
